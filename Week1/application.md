Application of data structure

# Arrray
 - lookup tables, sorting algorithms

# Linked list
 - dynamic memory, undo in editors, adjacency list in graphs
 
# String
 - DNA sequencing, search engines

# Linear Search
 - Small unsorted array

# Binary Search
 - Large sorted array

# Recursion
 - Divide and conquer (Merge sort, quick sort, tree traversal)
